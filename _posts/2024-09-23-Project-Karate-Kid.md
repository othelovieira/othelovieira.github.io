Growing up in the 80’s, I watched and absolutely loved the Karate Kid movies. 

Last Friday Odaclick Game Studio released [“The Karate Kid: Street Rumble”](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549780/The_Karate_Kid_Street_Rumble/) which is an homage to the original series and “old skool” beat ‘em ups. 

The game has an Extra Content section which has a 50-page “Art Book” which shows most of the art work used in the game. 

Not to give away any spoilers, I've screen grabbed the four main character sheets.
